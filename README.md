# Using-Brawlhalla-API

To visualize your own stats, one must first acquire a key from Brawlhalla devs. They were super timely with their response! Then, node is needed as it used to fetch personal statistics from the API. With `npm install`, the required packages and files can be downloaded from the package.json. 

Playerstats text file was only for development, but it shows what a typical response looks like, so I left it in. Charts.js uses the Charts library to visualize the data.
